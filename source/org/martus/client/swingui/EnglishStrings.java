To ensure that you'll always have access to your data, it is extremely important to keep a backup of your key.\n\nMartus offers two methods for backing up your key, either of which may be used, but we strongly recommend using both backup methods.  The first method creates a single, password encrypted key back up file onto removable media (e.g. floppy disk, cd, USB storage) or a network drive; the second method backs up the key in #M# separate pieces (not encrypted with your password) onto multiple floppy disks (or other removable media).\n",
"field:BackupKeyPairToSecretShareInformation=This method breaks up your key into #M# pieces, any #N# of which will be required to reconstruct the key without requiring a password.  If you forget your login name or your password, this method is the only way you can restore your key.\n\nOnce the #M# files have been written to removable media disks, you should distribute them to #M# different people whom you will remember, but each of whom don't know who you have given the other files to.  Do not store any of the disks together.\n\nTo restore your key, first retrieve any #N# of the original #M# disks, and then select 'Restore Account' and 'Restore account from multiple disks' when signing into Martus.\n",
